# Clustering-Analysis-for-Store-attributes
An academic project for marketing analytics which has a dataset of attributes related to equipment for office. Clustering analysis using R is performed to find the best attributes and 5-cluster is gained as an optimum number of clusters.


Ratings and recommendations made by consumers are not only significant performance indicators for the companies that get them, but they also serve as a vital source of information for future customers. Here in this project, we are going to explore a similar dataset office.csv in which 200 respondents were asked to rate the importance of several store attributes when choosing where to buy office equipment. 
The calculations that were based on the aforementioned observation revealed that the solution for 6 clusters had values of 8 in one of the segments, which is a very low number. This was discovered as a result of the discovery that one of the segments included the aforementioned observation. The solution that contains five clusters, on the other hand, has a lower value, and that number is 17. Taking all of this into mind, the solution that consists of five clusters is the one that works the best. When considering the implications for the company, it is important to note that the cost of computation will increase, but the return on investment for each additional cluster would be lower. Therefore, this is the rationale behind why the 5-cluster approach is appropriate for this dataset.
