# Clustering-Analysis-for-Store-attributes
An academic project for marketing analytics which has a dataset of attributes related to equipment for office. Clustering analysis using R is performed to find the best attributes and 5-cluster is gained as an optimum number of clusters.


Ratings and recommendations made by consumers are not only significant performance indicators for the companies that get them, but they also serve as a vital source of information for future customers. Here in this project, we are going to explore a similar dataset office.csv in which 200 respondents were asked to rate the importance of several store attributes when choosing where to buy office equipment. 
5-clusters and 6 cluster solution was tried on this dataset using Hierarchical clustering. 5-cluster solution is provided as best solution as the implications in business aspects will cost lesser in 5-cluster solution. Concordance of Hierarchical and K-means clustering is done and a hit rate of 99 is obtained. 

The HTML file of the RMD file will give a complete insight. For the complete report for this project please mail to vishwanathmankala@outlook.com
